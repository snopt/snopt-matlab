Using the SNOPT mex Files in $SNOPT/matlab
==========================================

 Run Matlab in the directory $SNOPT/matlab.

 At the Matlab prompt, type

  >> runQPExamples     % for qpopt
  >> runNPExamples     % for snopt

This script sets the matlab path appropriately.

 The subdirectory ./examples contains various sample problems
that demonstrate how to use the snOpt Matlab interfaces.  Read
the in-line help information for each m-file for more
information.  To run the individual m-files type

  >> setpath  % if you haven't already called run**Examples script
  >> snoptmain

SNOPT can be called via the Matlab m-file functions "snopt" and "snsolve".
snopt is similar to the Fortran version of SNOPTA.  snsolve is based off
Matlab's "fmincon".


If you provide the derivatives of your problem functions be sure to check them
first by setting the option:using the command:
>> option.verify_level = 3;


BOTTOM LINE: The more information you give, the FASTER and MORE RELIABLE the solve.
            (the  LONGER THE ARGUMENT LIST, the FASTER and MORE RELIABLE the solve)
